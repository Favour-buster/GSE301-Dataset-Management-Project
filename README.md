## Project Description
This project is a Python-based Dataset Management and Basic Analysis System developed to demonstrate core programming concepts used in Data Science and Machine Learning.

The system reads numerical and categorical data from external files, performs statistical analysis, handles errors, and saves results into a report file.

---

## Objectives of the Project
The project was designed to:
- Demonstrate file handling and error handling in Python
- Apply functions, loops, and conditional statements
- Use sets to extract unique categorical values
- Implement Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Perform basic statistical analysis on datasets

---

## Features Implemented
✔ Reading numerical data from a CSV file  
✔ Handling missing, empty, or invalid files  
✔ Calculation of:
- Total
- Average
- Minimum
- Maximum  

✔ Performance evaluation based on average score  
✔ Extraction of unique categories using sets  
✔ Report generation and file saving  
✔ Object-Oriented Programming using a `DataSet` class
